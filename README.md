# BOOK MY SHOW APP

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `PROJECT SUMMERY`

  Project Summary: Book My Show App

Our team of three developers successfully created a web application called Book My Show, which allows users to select movie names, choose a slot, and book seats for their preferred showtimes. The app also provides users with the option to view their previous bookings. The project utilized a combination of front-end and back-end technologies to deliver a seamless user experience.

Front-End Technologies:
- React: We chose React as our front-end framework due to its component-based architecture, which enabled us to create reusable UI elements and efficiently manage state throughout the application.
- CSS Styling: We used CSS to style the application, ensuring an attractive and intuitive user interface that aligns with the Book My Show brand.
- React Hooks: Leveraging React Hooks allowed us to manage state and perform side effects, such as API calls, within functional components.
- Axios: To fetch data from the server, we integrated Axios, a popular JavaScript library that simplifies the process of making HTTP requests.

Back-End Technologies:
- MongoDB: We selected MongoDB as our database to store movie details, slot information, seat availability, and user bookings. Its flexibility and scalability made it an ideal choice for our application.
- Express.js: As the back-end framework, Express.js facilitated the creation of a robust API for handling user requests, managing data, and communicating with the database.

User Flow:
1. Movie Selection: Users can select their preferred movie title.
2. Slot and Seat Selection: Once a movie is chosen, users can view available time slots and select one. They can then choose their desired seat numbers from a visual representation of the theater layout.
3. Booking Confirmation: When the user clicks "Book Now," the app processes the request and confirms the booking.
4. Previous Bookings: Users can access their booking history, which displays details such as movie name, slot, seat numbers.

Overall, our team successfully implemented a Book My Show app that allows users to conveniently book movie tickets online. By utilizing React, CSS, React Hooks, and Axios on the front end, along with MongoDB and Express.js on the back end, we delivered a seamless and user-friendly experience. The app offers the essential features of movie selection, slot and seat selection, booking confirmation, and a history of previous bookings.
